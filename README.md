# NimGameStrategy

The nim game staregy project was a project for one of my Computer Science classes.

This project was created to determine the best strategy to the card game Nim. I created Card, Card Pile, Hand and Deck objects to simulate a game of nim following the standard rules to the game of nim. Once a playable version of the game was created, I built several AI's that would be able to play against each other, each using a differnt startegy; playing biggest card, playing smallest card and random card. The AI's were then played against each other in a tournament with a large amount of games and the win percentage of each AI was tracked to determine the best strategy to the game of Nim.
